*What are product codes? What are its types? Why are product codes used?*

A product code describes a specific product and contains a combination of five to seven numbers and letters. These are the codes that are usually on the back of the product. These codes are important mainly due to its unique nature.

### Types of Product Codes

**UPC**:
Universal Product Code (UPC) is a 12-digit bar code used extensively for retail packaging in the United States.
A typical process of obtaining a 12-digit UPC number is as follows:
- License a unique Company Prefix from your local GS1 office. GS1 is a not-for-profit organisation that develops and maintains global standards for business communication.
- Assign product number(s) to unique products making your number equal 11 digits
- Using a check digit calculator with your 11 digit number, generate your check digit.

**EAN**:
The European Article Number (EAN) is a barcode standard, a 12- or 13-digit product identification code. Each EAN uniquely identifies the product, manufacturer, and its attributes;
typically, the EAN is printed on a product label or packaging as a bar code. We require EAN codes to improve the quality of search results and the quality of the catalogue as a
whole.

**ISBN**:
The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique commercial book identifier barcode. Each ISBN code identifies uniquely a book. ISBN have either 10 or 13 digits.
Typically, the ISBN is printed on the back cover of the book.

**ASINs**:
Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) are unique blocks of 10 letters and/or numbers that identify items. You can find the ASIN on the item's product information page at
Amazon.com. For books, the ASIN is the same as the ISBN, but for all other products, a new ASIN is created when the item is uploaded to our catalogue.
